# Hello, I'm Luiz Gustavo Junqueira! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my space dedicated to Computing and the Web.

Here, I share my thoughts and discoveries, focusing on web development, system architecture, and especially on technologies and specific topics that interest me.

My mission is to explore the core fundamentals of technologies in order to keep a record for myself in the future and for anyone who might need it.
